# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

### Project Summary
The goal of this project is to give you a taste of the environment and tools you will most likely come across in a front end role. Your focus should be to understand the role every tool and technology is playing in the overall architecture, but you shouldnâ€™t feel the need to memorize the particular commands, config setups, or structure that we create here. Every company - and even every project - will have its own custom setup, but if you understand the moving pieces you will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this one.

### The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls
